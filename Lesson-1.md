# Lesson 1: Setting up the Bakery
Alright, time to set up your computers so we can do some robot coding!

## Task 1: Install IntelliJ IDEA
Alright, first we are going to install IntelliJ IDEA. IntelliJ is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that we will use to write the robot code. If you google IntelliJ, you will see that there are 2 versions: Ultimate and Community. We are going to use the Ultimate edition because we want all of the bells and whistles, so [click here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/ "CLICK ME"). When you install, it will say that you have a free trial until you can get a license. Normally, licenses call a lot of money, but you can get a free student license [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students) and you can sign up as long as you have something that proves you are a student (Student ID, ACT or SAT Scores, transcript, etc.). If you are having trouble, just let me know and I will try to get you a license.

When you are running the IntelliJ Setup Wizard, you will see a couple of prompts. After you pick a theme, try to get your screen to match mine. If you can't, that's okay, but it just makes life slightly easier.

After this one, you can click through the rest of the installers. At this point, you can exit IntelliJ, as you will need to install Git and Gradle next.

## Task 2: Install Git
Next, we are going to install Git. Git is a programming tool that allows you to upload all of your code changes to Github. Essentially, as you upload your changes, I can see what you have made and I can track your progress. To install Git, [click here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and pick your Operating System. Honestly, you can click through these prompts to finish the installer.

## Task 3: Install Gradle

## Task 4: Install Java Development Kit

## Task 5: Setup JDK

## Task 6: Setup Gradle Libraries
