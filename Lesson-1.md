# Lesson 1: Setting up the Bakery
Alright, time to set up your computers so we can do some robot coding!

## Task 1: Install IntelliJ IDEA
Alright, first we are going to install IntelliJ IDEA. IntelliJ is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that we will use to write the robot code. If you google IntelliJ, you will see that there are 2 versions: Ultimate and Community. We are going to use the Ultimate edition because we want all of the bells and whistles, so [click here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/ "CLICK ME"). When you install, it will say that you have a free trial until you can get a license. Normally, licenses call a lot of money, but you can get a free student license [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students) and you can sign up as long as you have something that proves you are a student (Student ID, ACT or SAT Scores, transcript, etc.). If you are having trouble, just let me know and I will try to get you a license.

When you are running the IntelliJ Setup Wizard, you will see a couple of prompts. After you pick a theme, try to get your screen to match mine. If you can't, that's okay, but it just makes life slightly easier.

After this one, you can click through the rest of the installers. At this point, you can exit IntelliJ, as you will need to install Git and Gradle next.

## Task 2: Install Git
Next, we are going to install Git. Git is a programming tool that allows you to upload all of your code changes to Github. Essentially, as you upload your changes, I can see what you have made and I can track your progress. To install Git, [click here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and pick your Operating System. Honestly, you can click through these prompts to finish the installer.

## Task 3: Install Java Development Kit
Now, we have to install the Java Development Kit (JDK). The JDK allows us to use Java to write our own programs, and without it we will not be able to do anything with the robot. Even if you already have Java installed on your computer, you may not neccesarily have the JDK installed, as that is a separate component that is not bundled with the general Java installation. To install the JDK, [click here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and accept the agreement for JDK 8u162. Afterwards, you will be able to install the JDK for your operating system.

## Task 4: Install Gradle
Now, we will install Gradle. Gradle is the build system that we will be using to build and deploy the robot code. To install gradle, [click here](https://gradle.org/install/#manually) and follow the instructions listed to install Gradle manually.

## Task 5: Clone Repository
Before we finish installing everything, now you need to clone this GitHub repository to your computer. Cloning the repository creates a local version of this folder and will also allow you to push your changes to the online version. To clone the repository, open IntelliJ and click on **Check Out from Version Control**. Afterwards, click on GitHub, select **Password** for **Auth Type** and type in your username and password. Once you do so, it should ask you which repository you want to clone, and just select **TT-2018-Summer-Project**.

## Task 5: Setup JDK
We are in the home stretch guys! Now, we need to make sure that IntelliJ knows where the JDK is

## Task 6: Setup Gradle Libraries
