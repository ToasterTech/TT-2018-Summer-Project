# TT-2018-Summer-Project

Hey guys, so remember when I said an idea to how to teach y'all Java Programmning? Well, this is it. Over the course of this repository, you guys will be recoding parts of our robot, so that when you come back in August, you will be good to go.

## Structure of the Class
So, a large part of this project is going to be project-based. In other words, I'm going to expect y'all to be doing some research and working on your own. I will be avaliable to provide y'all with any hints, but I reccomend that you work with each other first to find a solution. Now, by working with each other, I expect you guys to provide support. However, I do NOT want y'all to do the work for each other. I should be getting a solution for each person. The lessons will be delivered in the forms of videos that I am recording and uploading to this playlist. When you think you have a solution, please phrase your commit as "Lesson 1 Solution" and dm me so I will know to check it. The link to the playlist is [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLY4VF0jkvrzaWd2E1ADGU1KF7sAZmS6H8).
