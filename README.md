# TT-2018-Summer-Project

Hey guys, so remember when I said an idea to how to teach y'all Java Programmning? Well, this is it. Over the course of this repository, you guys will be recoding parts of our robot, so that when you come back in August, you will be good to go.

## Structure of the Class
So, a large part of this project is going to be project-based. In other words, I'm going to expect y'all to be doing some research and working on your own. I will be avaliable to provide y'all with any hints, but I reccomend that you work with each other first to find a solution. Now, by working with each other, I expect you guys to provide support. However, I do NOT want y'all to do the work for each other. I should be getting a solution for each person.

## Roadmap
I'm still finalizing this roadmap, but here is what i have so far:

| Lesson # | Title | Difficulty |
|:----------:|----------|:----------:|
|1|So, in this lesson you guys will be setting up IntelliJ, Git and GradleRIO.|Easy|
|2|In this lesson, you guys will learn about the robot methods and make a drivetrain subsystem. You will also make a command that allows us to drive the robot with the gamepad.|Easy|
|3|In this lesson, you guys will make your first autonomous method and hopefully earn 5 points.|Medium|
|4|In this lesson, y'all will create the elevator subsystem and create the command to move it up and down.|Easy|
|5| TBD | Medium Probably |
